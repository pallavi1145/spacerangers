        <h2>About Space Technology</h2>
        <p>Space technology refers to the tools and machines we use to explore space. This includes satellites that help with communication and weather, rockets that carry things into space, space probes that study other planets, and space stations where astronauts live. It helps us learn about the universe and improve life on Earth!</p>
        <h3>Why It's Important</h3>
        <p>Space technology impacts our world by enabling GPS navigation, weather forecasts, climate monitoring, and scientific discovery. The field offers limitless possibilities for exploration and innovation.</p>
        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Mangalyaan is a spaceship that went to Mars in 2013, making India the first country to reach Mars on its first try. That's super cool! </li>
            <li>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first trip to the moon in 2008, and it found water on the moon, which was a big surprise!</li>
            <li>ISRO, India's space agency, launched 104 satellites all at once in 2017, breaking a world record for the most satellites sent into space in one go! </li>
            <li> The first Indian in space was Rakesh Sharma, who flew on a Soviet spacecraft in 1984. He even said, "Saare Jahan Se Achha" when he saw India from space!</li>
            <li>ISRO's PSLV rocket is known as the "workhorse" of the Indian space program because it has successfully launched many satellites into space.</li>
            <li>The Gaganyaan mission will send Indian astronauts into space for the first time, and it's planned to happen soon!</li>
            <li>ISRO is planning a mission called Aditya-L1 to study the sun and learn about solar activities that affect Earth.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="gis">
        <h2>GIS and the Importance of GIS Day</h2>
        <h3>What is GIS?</h3>
        <p> Geographic Information System, is a tool that helps us make maps and understand where things are in the world. It collects information about places, like roads and rivers, and shows it in a way that's easy to see. This helps people make good decisions about things like building parks or keeping the environment safe. It’s like using a super smart map!</p>
        <h3>GIS in Space Technology</h3>
        <p>GIS in space technology helps us use data from satellites to create maps and analyze information about Earth and other planets. It plays a key role in understanding environmental changes, planning space missions, and managing disasters. In short, GIS makes the data we get from space easier to understand and use!</p>
        <h3>Why GIS Day Matters</h3>
        <p>GIS Day is celebrated globally to promote the power of GIS in addressing challenges like climate change and urban planning. Students are encouraged to learn about mapping and participate in GIS events.</p>
